The Sun spectrum

The power spectrum of the sun, the dependence of power emitted within an interval of photon energies Eph can be approximated by the radiation of a black body with a temperature Ts given by the Plank equation

The velocity of light (c) is equal to 2.99 x 10^8 m/s and the Boltzman constant (kB) is given as 1.38 x 10^-23 J/K. The spectrum for the black body radiation for 5800 K is
